The first non-political political show! As a software engineer and documentary filmmaker, host <a href="https://twitter.com/BradRCorlett">Brad Corlett</a> navigates us through political issues in a non-ideological manner. The goal of this podcast is to arm folks with the tools necessary to decode the media and consider ideas from an open minded evidence based lens rather than a political lens. Check us out at vlpod.com or on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/verticallinepod">@VerticalLinePod</a>.<br>
